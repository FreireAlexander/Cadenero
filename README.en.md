# Cadenero 0.0.0-dev0

Cadenero is '__by now__' a console application that allows you to perform simple surveying and geoinformation computations. \
Calculations such as:


1. Compute coordinates from an initial coordinate, distance and angle.
2. Compute angles between Azimuths to Bearings and Vicerversa.
3. Compute the angle, azimuth or bearing between two coordinates.
4. Compute distances between coordinates
5. and so on...

at the moment the application is only available in a trial version and runs only from a terminal,
in the future we are looking for it to have a graphical interface available for Linux and Windows operating systems
with possibilities for FreeBSD based operating systems.
